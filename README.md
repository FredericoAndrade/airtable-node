Airtable / Node
===============

This project has a module showing how to connect to [Airtable](https://airtable.com) from an Express/Node server. The module is located at `app/modules/airtable-crud.js`.

This draws heavily from Remy Sharp's [Mongoose CRUD](https://gist.github.com/remy/6c49b83c071bf90dd108cc0cce555f57).

Getting started
---------------

1. Add your API key and base ID to `.env`
2. Change the table name in `app/app.js`
3. If you're running this locally, run `npm install` and then `npm start` on the [command line](https://www.kevinmcgillivray.net/introduction-to-text-editors-and-the-command-line/)
4. If you're running this on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/~airtable-node), click the "Show" button!
